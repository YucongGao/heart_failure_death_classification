# heart_failure_death_classification

Heart failure is a very serious disease globally. About 6.2 million adults in the US have heart failure
and 379,800 deaths were associated with heart failure in 2018. In this analysis, I use 299 records
of patients who had heart failure and applied classification algorithms to predict the survivorship
using 12 feature predictors. In doing so, we may understand what medical feature should be
closely monitored after a patient had heart failure and what treatment can be used to reduce the
probability of death.
